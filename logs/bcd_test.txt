Pass 6: Building marker chains...
  Found 1 chain(s) with 60s spacing
  Chain 1: 2 markers, score=52.7, sec59_silent=2/2

===========================================
BEST CHAIN SELECTED (Chain 1 of 1)
===========================================
  Chain length: 2 markers
  Score: 52.7 / 100
  Sec 59 silent: 2/2 (100%)
  Sec 29 silent: 1/2 (50%)
  Avg duration error: 300 ms (from 800ms)
  Avg confidence: 84%

  Chain members (with refined edge detection):
    [1] start=21238.6ms, end=21723.7ms, dur=485ms (was 545ms), sec29=silent, sec59=silent
    [2] start=81842.2ms, end=82400.5ms, dur=558ms (was 456ms), sec29=TICK, sec59=silent

  TIMING CALCULATION:
  Using marker START for timing (WWV minute starts at pulse onset)
    Marker 1: start=21238.6ms, offset=21238.6ms, weight=1.11
    Marker 2: start=81842.2ms, offset=21842.2ms, weight=0.64
    Weighted average offset: 21459.1 ms
