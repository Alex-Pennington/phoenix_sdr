    [2] start=70957.4ms, end=71543.3ms, dur=586ms (was 497ms), sec29=silent, sec59=silent

  TIMING CALCULATION:
  Using marker START for timing (WWV minute starts at pulse onset)
    Marker 1: start=10959.7ms, offset=10959.7ms, weight=1.21
    Marker 2: start=70957.4ms, offset=10957.4ms, weight=0.99
    Weighted average offset: 10958.6 ms
