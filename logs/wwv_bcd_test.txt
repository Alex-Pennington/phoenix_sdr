    [4] start=261623.4ms, end=262359.6ms, dur=736ms (was 743ms), sec29=silent, sec59=silent

  TIMING CALCULATION:
  Using marker START for timing (WWV minute starts at pulse onset)
    Marker 1: start=81238.6ms, offset=21238.6ms, weight=1.11
    Marker 2: start=141842.2ms, offset=21842.2ms, weight=0.64
    Marker 3: start=200925.1ms, offset=20925.1ms, weight=1.47
    Marker 4: start=261623.4ms, offset=21623.4ms, weight=1.61
    Weighted average offset: 21351.0 ms

  TIMING RESULT
  ============================================
  First minute boundary: 21.351 sec into recording
  Recording started: 38.649 sec after UTC minute
  Offset from file start to minute: 21351.0 ms
  ============================================
  Quality: GOOD - Reliable timing
