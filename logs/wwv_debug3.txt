  Chain members (with refined edge detection):
    [1] start=81264.6ms, end=81721.5ms, dur=457ms (was 516ms), sec29=silent, sec59=silent
    [2] start=141839.5ms, end=142572.1ms, dur=733ms (was 623ms), sec29=silent, sec59=TICK
    [3] start=200923.5ms, end=201677.8ms, dur=754ms (was 785ms), sec29=TICK, sec59=silent
    [4] start=261619.4ms, end=262357.7ms, dur=738ms (was 761ms), sec29=TICK, sec59=silent

  TIMING CALCULATION:
  Using marker START for timing (WWV minute starts at pulse onset)
    Marker 1: start=81264.6ms, offset=21264.6ms, weight=1.04
    Marker 2: start=141839.5ms, offset=21839.5ms, weight=0.81
    Marker 3: start=200923.5ms, offset=20923.5ms, weight=1.46
    Marker 4: start=261619.4ms, offset=21619.4ms, weight=1.40
    Weighted average offset: 21362.8 ms

  ============================================
  TIMING RESULT
  ============================================
  First minute boundary: 21.363 sec into recording
  Recording started: 38.637 sec after UTC minute
  Offset from file start to minute: 21362.8 ms
  ============================================
  Quality: GOOD - Reliable timing
